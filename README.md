# CIS-2520

Assignment 1 was to display all combinations of the word 'CARBON'
It also displays the Ackermann and two Newton functions.

The Akermann function asks for 2 numbers m and n for the function A(m,n).

If m = 0, n + 1

If m>0 and n=0, A(m-1,1)

If m>0 and n>0, then A((m-1), A(m,n-1))

The Newton approximation function is where one starts with an initial guess which is reasonably close to the root. The function is approximated by it's tangent line and guesses and checks to come closer. Two methods of this are done, through recursive and non-recursive programming and compared with each other using a time function.
