**********
Compilation
**********

Use makefile, by compiling with "make" in the terminal

**********
Running the Program(s)
**********

Run with ./A1
It uses scanf function to obtain values from the user.
The first displays all combinations of "CARBON", when the user presses any character on the keyboard except 'x'.
The second displays the Akermann function.  According to the assignment, it has to display 3 pairs, so it will ask for each pair after providing the result of the previous pair.
The second is the Newton approximation function.  There are two functions, a recursive format, since the function calls itself, and a non-recursive, where the function uses a 'while' loop.  Each function is timed using ftime() function.  However, since the operation is so fast, each function is repeated 100,000 times.  A difference in time is displayed as well as which operation was faster.

**********
Testing
**********

Tested the limit of Akermann function before segmentation fault. The limit is shown in terminal as m=3 and n=14
Tested Newton values of no more than 100,000 for x and a and 0.01 for e. 



**********
Known Limitations
**********

In Akermann function, any number larger than those explained provides a time out error due to lack of memory
Depending on the size of the variables, the Newton function can provide no difference in time or a large difference in time.  To compensate, each function is repeated 100,000 times, so the real difference in time is actually 100,000 times smaller.
