**********
Compilation
**********

Use makefile, by compiling with "make" in the terminal

**********
Running the Program(s)
**********
To run the car maintenance program type: ./q1
To run the postfix program type: ./q2 and the postfix expression in quotes "".

**********
Testing
**********

Q1: Tested prefix,infix,postfix,update variables and calculations on: no variables, single variables, 2 variables
Display tree for option 1 doesn't work, although I know what to do. 
"(1.55-1.22)", "(1.11+x1)", "(x1*x2)" are the examples I used to test each functionality.
If the calculate option is made without a variable being declared, it is automatically set to 0.00.

Q2: Ran the f.dat file.  Sorts the key into downheap order.  It adds each line, finds the key.  The child value is the read line, and the parent is the child/2.  The child and parent are min sorted, so that if the child is bigger, the elements are swapped.  This keeps on happening until the child is larger than the parent.


**********
Known Limitations
**********

If " " are not put before the expression, the program terminates

**********
References
**********

Used code from tutorial based from my TA to take in three numbers and insert into stack as a float.  Used the same methodology to memcpy my variables into my float stack.
Calculation was based upon my (Simon Ko) assignment 2 part 2.
